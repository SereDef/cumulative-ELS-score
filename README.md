# cumulative-ELS-score
Set of scripts building a cumulative psycho-social risk score across two developmental periods (pregnancy and childhood) based on Generation R and ALSPAC data.

These scores are based on Cecil et al., 2014; Rijlaarsdam et al., 2016; Schuurmans (in preparation). They attempt to capture a global and cmulative exposure to stressors during pregnancy and across childhood (from birth to 10 years of age 7-10). 

Prenatal and postnatal ELS scores are based on five cumulative (additive) risk domains: Life events (e.g. death of a parent or pregnancy complications), contextual risk (e.g. financial difficulties or neighbourhood problems), parental risk (e.g. parental criminal record or parental depression) and interpersonal risk (e.g. family conflicts or loss of a friend) and direct victimization (only available postnatally, e.g. bullying or harsh parenting).

These indicators were harmonized across Generation and ALSPAC cohorts with respect to closest item-similarity and used to calculate cumulative risk scores spanning from birth to 10 years of age.
